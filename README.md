##  Libraries & Frameworks -  
* React/Hooks
* Redux 
* React Router
* [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) were used to build the scraper
* Semantic UI React for some componente 

## The Database
* There is a Rails API database for this project, located in [this](https://github.com/gnardinosaur/culture_backend) repo. 

## Additional Notes
This was my final project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering immersive program. The main goal was to use new technologies I had not yet utilized like Redux, cheerio/axios, etc. 

I originally intended for the application to send users a daily email but ran into some hurdles with cron and the Mac OS I'm running, Catalina. 

It took me roughly four days to ideate, draw out the UI, and test a few libaries I wanted to use, and about a week and half to build.
