    artist: "Canaletto (Giovanni Antonio Canal)",
    date: "late 1720s",
    description: ["The most celebrated view painter of eighteenth-century Venice, Canaletto was particularly popular with British visitors to the city. This wonderfully fresh and well-preserved canvas shows Piazza San Marco. Canaletto reduced the number of windows in the bell tower and extended the height of the flagstaffs, but otherwise he took few liberties with the cityscape. Jayne Wrightsman purchased this work for the Museum in 1988 with the intention of grounding its strong holdings of Venetian view paintings."]

    artist: "Titian",
    date: "1550s",
    description: ["Tales from Ovid’s inspired Titian to paint what he called , or poetry in paint. Here, Venus tries to stop her lover from departing for the hunt, fearing—correctly—that he would be killed. The mood of sensuality, conveyed by the beautiful depiction of Venus from the back, enhances the viewer’s sense of the tragic end to this story, expressed through their exchanged glances and the frightened Cupid. Titian’s workshop made multiple versions of this composition, but this one is of exceptional quality and was painted by Titian himself."]

    title: "Still Life with Apples and a Pot of Primroses",
    culture: "",
    artist: "Paul Cézanne",
    date: "ca 1890",
    description: ["Cézanne rarely painted flowering plants or fresh-cut bouquets, which were susceptible to wilting under his protracted gaze. He included potted plants only in three still lifes, two views of the conservatory at Jas de Bouffan, his family's estate, and about a dozen exquisite watercolors made over the course of two decades (from about 1878 to 1906). Cézanne seems to have reserved this particular table, with its scalloped apron and distinctive bowed legs, for three of his finest still lifes of the 1890s.", "This painting was once owned by the ardent gardener Claude Monet."]
